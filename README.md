```

### Requirements

- Python 3.6+

- Requests
- Pillow

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python color_harvest.py https://example.com
```

This will:
1. Extract up to 20 most common colors from the website
2. Filter out grayscale, white, and black colors by default
3. Save results to a JSON file named after the domain
4. Generate an HTML visualization of the color palette

### Command Line Options

```bash
python color_harvest.py https://example.com [options]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--colors N` | Number of colors to extract (default: 20) |
| `--output NAME` | Custom output filename base |
| `--keep-grayscale` | Include grayscale colors in results |
| `--keep-white` | Include white colors in results |
| `--keep-black` | Include black colors in results |
| `--keep-all` | Include all colors (no filtering) |

### Examples

Extract 30 colors from a website and include grayscale colors:
```bash
python color_harvest.py https://example.com --colors 30 --keep-grayscale
```

Save results with a custom filename:
```bash
python color_harvest.py https://example.com --output my_color_palette
```

Include all colors without filtering:
```bash
python color_harvest.py https://example.com --keep-all
```

## Output

### JSON Format

The tool creates a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "colors": [
    {"hex": "#3498db", "frequency": 42},
    {"hex": "#e74c3c", "frequency": 27},
    ...
  ],
  "filters": {
    "grayscale_filtered": true,
    "white_filtered": true,
    "black_filtered": true
  }
}
```

### HTML Visualization

The generated HTML file provides a visual representation of the color palette with:
- Color preview
- Hex value (clickable to copy)
- RGB value
- Occurrence count

## How It Works

Color Harvest analyzes websites through several methods:

1. Extracts colors from `<style>` tags in the HTML
2. Finds colors in inline style attributes
3. Downloads and analyzes linked CSS files
4. Processes images to identify dominant colors
5. Filters results based on user preferences
6. Generates a count of color occurrences
7. Creates an interactive HTML visualization
